  <h1 class="postTitle">Title Page: Book of Mormon</h1>
  <p class="meta">March 22, 2020 | <span class="time">18</span>
    Minute Read</p>

  <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello, friends! This is the first post in an ongoing series of what will be an in-depth analysis of the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon—whether you believe it is divine and historical or a 19th-century work of pseudepigrapha—has deeply influenced millions of people. I have read and studied this book over thirty times in my life. Now I will be studying it from a new perspective because I have changed my position from a true believing member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to a disbeliever. I now view the Book of Mormon as non-historical 19th-century Bible fan fiction fabricated by Joseph Smith.</p>

<p>Many of my friends and family, who will be the most inclined to read my posts, hold the Book of Mormon as the infallible word of God. I want the believer to know that I will do my best to be respectful while also sharing arguments, history, and perspectives that bring the honest seeker of truth to a different vantage point. If you follow along I think we will both come out of this more informed and enlightened on the subject. I welcome all criticism, corrections, and comments.</p>

<p>Jeffery R. Holland said a member cannot leave the church without “crawling over or under or around the Book of Mormon to make that exit.”<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup> That cannot be said of me or the thousands of post-Mormons that have left because of major issues in the book. Let’s dive in and see for ourselves what is in this controversial and fascinating book, starting from the title page.</p>

<h3 id="the-title-page">THE TITLE PAGE</h3>

<h2 id="who-wrote-the-title-page"><strong>WHO WROTE THE TITLE PAGE?</strong></h2>

<p>The first edition of the Book of Mormon has Joseph Smith as the “author and proprietor”, however, this is not what Joseph Smith claimed. Using “author and proprietor” was used to comply with copyright laws. Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon from a set of gold plates in an unknown language that the book itself refers to as “reformed Egyptian.”<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup></p>

<p>According to Smith, “the title-page of the Book of Mormon is a literal translation, taken from the very last leaf, on the left hand side of the collection or book of plates, which contained the record which has been translated, the language of the whole running the same as all Hebrew writing in general; and that said title page is not by any means a modern composition, either of mine or of any other man who has lived or does live in this generation.”<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup></p>

<p>From the believers perspective it can be concluded that the title page was translated using the same method David Whitmer described:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joseph Smith put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

  <figcaption>Between 1819-1827, Joseph made money as a money digger. His role in these excursions was to use a stone in the bottom of his white top hat to view treasure beneath the earth and tell others where to dig. This image imagines what Joseph would have looked like during this period. It was made using the youngest available photos of his sons, his death mask, and a body borrowed from a contemporary. https://www.knowbrotherjoseph.com/young-joseph</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One can picture Smith putting his face in his white stovepipe hat while dictating the title page to a scribe while the plates were supposedly hidden in the woods. The title page was “translated” by Smith <em>after</em> the storyline of the book was complete using his chocolate-colored seer stone which originally belonged to Smith’s treasure seeking companion Willard Chase. The seer stone was later referred to as a Urim and Thummim by Smith’s followers four years after the publication of the book.<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Connecting the peep stone to the ancient Urim and Thummim referred to in the Bible faired well for Mormonism in that it distracted new followers from connecting the stone with Smith’s earlier money digs, even though Aaron’s biblical Urim and Thummim has little resemblance to 19th-century peep stones. The term Urim and Thummim is still heavily used today to describe the translation process while the stonepipe hat and peep stone receive little attention.</p>

<p>The Book of Mormon claims that a prophet-historian named Mormon abridged the history of the people in the Americas by engraving the reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics on golden plates in ~400 AD. Mormon’s son Moroni inherited the golden records and abridged an additional 24 plates of gold from “the people of Jared” (aka “Jaredites”) and added commentary of his own before burying the plates in upstate New York for Smith to find one thousand four hundred years later. The title page was the last leaf Moroni engraved, according to Smith. It’s as if Moroni lived in the 19th-century since title pages were first used in the 16th century. The title page should thus be regarded by the faithful as truly miraculous since Moroni wrote it before its invention.</p>

<p>So, who is the author of the title page of the Book of Mormon? In 1842 Joseph Smith claimed Moroni was. Some LDS scholars make an argument that Mormon authored the first paragraph and Moroni authored the second paragraph.⁷ A more compelling answer is that Joseph Smith is the author of the title page.</p>

<p>How could it be concluded that Smith is the author of the title page? After the 116 page manuscript was lost Joseph continued “translating” the Book of Mormon from Mosiah to Moroni, perhaps holding out hope that the lost manuscript would be found. After the Book of Moroni was complete, Smith dictated 1 Nephi to The Words of Mormon from the conveniently included small plates of Nephi which Mormon inserted at the end of his abridgment. Another miracle that believing members seem to overlook is that Nephi must have created his small plates to be the same dimensions to be included in Mormon’s D-shaped ring plates.</p>

<p>Smith obtained the copyright to the Book of Mormon from E. B. Grandin on June 11th, 1829. During this time, Smith would have been finishing the remainder of 2 Nephi which we can compare to the title page and look for similarities. 2 Nephi 26:12-13 reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>12 And as I spake concerning the <strong>convincing of the Jews</strong>, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the <strong>Gentiles be convinced</strong> also that <strong>Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God</strong>;</p>

  <p>13 And that he <strong>manifesteth himself</strong> unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bolded text in the above passage has striking similarities with the title page—as if Nephi and Moroni are the same author—especially when considering that “JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD” only appears in these two places in the entire Book of Mormon , linking Joseph as the author of both texts.<sup><a href="#references">8</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-last-leaf--charles-anthon">THE LAST LEAF &amp; CHARLES ANTHON</h2>

<p>What if we could see what the last leaf of the gold plates—which supposedly contained the text of the title page of the Book of Mormon—looked like? Would it prove Joseph’s seership or be another blunder like the papyri Smith translated as the Book of Abraham? We don’t have the plates to examine but we might be able to re-construct what Smith claimed the last leaf looked like.</p>

<p>Martin Harris, who funded the Book of Mormon translation and publication, wanted evidence of the authenticity of the plates for his own benefit and to ease the criticism that he was being scammed by Smith. Smith prepared a facsimile for Harris to take to “learned” scholars and linguists that Harris hoped would silence the critics and reassure his investment. The document that Smith produced for Harris—which has been lost to history but described by Charles Anthon, Charles W. Brown, Harris’ neighbor Francis Gladden Bishop and Joseph Smith Sr.—was described as the last leaf and reportedly looked similar to the Aztec calendar.</p>

<p>The facsimile’s connection with the last leaf and title page is described best by Don Bradley:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Martin took the facsimile of the final, sealed plate first to politician, scholar, and world traveler Luther Bradish in Albany and then to the distinguished scholars Samuel Mitchill and Charles Anthon in New York City. According to Anthon, the document carried by Martin Harris was a “transcript of a page of the Golden Bible”—i.e., a facsimile of a single plate from the set Joseph had recovered. But which plate? Joseph’s mother recalled him wanting to send an “alphabet” from the plates, and Joseph’s father recounted that such an alphabet was contained on the last plate of the book of plates. Fitting together the various puzzle pieces provided by Anthon, Joseph Sr., and Lucy Mack Smith, it appears that what Joseph sent to the scholars was a transcript or facsimile of the concluding plate…</p>

  <p>Six years after examining the facsimile Anthon described it as consisting of “all kinds of crooked characters disposed in columns.” It included “crosses and flourishes” and characters from “various alphabets.” In Anthon’s later account he described characters from Hebrew and Greek. On Martin’s report Anthon had said “they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic” (JS─H1:64). The characters were “arranged in perpendicular columns, and the whole ended in a rude delineation of a circle divided into various compartments, decked with various strange marks.” Anthon saw in this circular design an echo of “the Mexican Calender given by Humboldt,” meaning the Aztec calendar published by Alexander Von Humboldt in 1814.</p>
</blockquote>

  <figcaption>Aztec calendar from Alexander von Humboldt, Researches Concerning the Institutions &amp; Monuments of the Ancient Inhabitants of America, 1814, plate XXIII.</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1841 Anthon would again describe the paper Harris presented him:</p>

  <p>The characters were arranged in columns, like the [C]hinese mode of writing, and presented the most singular medley that I had ever beheld. Greek, Hebrew, and all sorts of letters . . . were intermingled with sundry delineations of half moons, stars, and other natural objects, and the whole ended in a rude representation of the Mexican zodiac. “An informant,” possibly Charles W. Brown, reported to Orsamus Turner that Martin had shown him the facsimile Joseph had drawn, which the informant understood to transcribe the plates’ “title page.” He described it as containing “concentric circles, between, above, and below which were characters, with little resemblance to letters.” This account of a circular symbol on the plates facsimile resembles Anthon’s description of a symbol resembling the Aztec calendar, which consisted of a sun symbol surrounded by concentric circles and divided into symbol-laden compartments by the sun’s rays.</p>

  <p>Martin’s Kirtland, Ohio, neighbor and confidant Francis Gladden Bishop, who acquired considerable information from Martin, gave this description in 1850:</p>

  <p>On the last plate . . . is a circle with rays proceeding from it resembling the sun, as commonly sketched, and around this circle are twenty-four circles more, but of a different character from the first, as each of these circles is composed of figures resembling stars, and half-moons—as, a star, then a half-moon, and so continued until the twenty-four circles are complete.<sup><a href="#references">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anthon and his contemporaries couldn’t have translated Egyptian, let alone reformed Egyptian, because the Rosetta Stone had not yet unlocked the key to translating Egyptian hieroglyphics. This served as evidence to Harris that Smith was more gifted than the scholars and linguists. When Smith translated the title page, coinciding with 2 Nephi 26 as shown above, he retrofitted a prophecy of the encounter between Harris and Anthon in 2 Nephi 27 to make it look like it was a fulfillment of prophecy from the biblical passage in Isaiah 29. The plagiarism of Isaiah 29 and Smith’s attempt to modernize it into a fulfilled prophecy will be deconstructed further at a later time.</p>

<h2 id="reformed-egyptian-or-deformed-english">REFORMED EGYPTIAN OR DEFORMED ENGLISH</h2>

<p>While the facsimile that Harris showed Professor Anthon is lost we do have a portion of the characters that Smith claimed were reformed Egyptian. The ‘Caractors’ document is the closest we can get to seeing what Smith claimed were the reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics found on the golden plates and can be viewed on the <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/appendix-2-document-1-characters-copied-by-john-whitmer-circa-1829-1831/1%23historical-intro">Joseph Smith Paper’s Project</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Instead of ”Re-formed Egyptian” many of the “Caractors” are deformed English, as any one will observe who will compare them with English letters, figures and signs.”<sup><a href="#references">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2020-03-22/caracters-deformed-english.png" alt="https://www.missedinsunday.com/memes/scripture/caractors/" /></p>

<p>These characters have been examined in great depth by historian Dan Vogel which can be viewed on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/aMPFKZ2E4MM">https://youtu.be/aMPFKZ2E4MM</a></p>

<h2 id="title-page-commentary">TITLE PAGE COMMENTARY</h2>

<p>The title page can be overwhelming to a new reader of the text. Some commentary on the title page will be somewhat helpful in understanding this sometimes complex book of scripture:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “people of Nephi” refer to the Nephites who were primarily the righteous peoples in the Book of Mormon and set apart from other groups by their advanced warfare, white and delightsome skin color, and having a knowledge of Christianity 600 years before Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>written to the Lamanites… and… Jew and Gentile</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lamanites are <del>the principal</del><sup><a href="#references">11</a></sup> among the ancestors of the American Indians. According to the book, the white skinned Nephites were destroyed because of their wickedness by the cursed dark-skinned Lamanites 400 years after the coming of Christ. Moroni was the last Nephite who completed the abridgment and buried the golden book close to Smith’s property on a hill that was used by the glass lookers to find buried treasure. The destruction of the Nephites left the Native Americans devoid of any knowledge of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon, according to the author, was written to bring the message of Christianity to these ancient mound builders while also settling the debates prevalent in 19th-century religious revivals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>written and sealed and hid up unto the Lord</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Noah Webster’s 1828 dictionary, to “seal up” the book means simply “to inclose; to hide; to conceal” or “to keep secret.”<sup><a href="#references">12</a></sup> Smith may have used the word seal to refer to the circular pattern of the facsimile he produced for Harris as the last leaf in the golden bible similar to the Great Seal of the United States on the back of a dollar or Turkish travel certificates that resemble Anthon’s description of the characters document in having circular symbols (seals) and representations of moons and stars.<sup><a href="#references">13</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>come forth by the gift and power of God</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gold plates were translated by the gift and power of God according to Smith. Smith did not leave much commentary on the translation process perhaps to distance himself from the controversial means of how the book came forth (using his chocolate colored peep stone by placing it in his white stonepipe hat and dictated to a scribe).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to come forth in due time by the way of Gentile</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smith dictated several prophecies about himself in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine &amp; Covenants, and the Joseph Smith revision or translation of the King James Version of the Bible. Joseph Smith was the gentile to bring forth the translation of the ancient record.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An abridgment…of the people of Jared</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Book of Mormon forces the orthodox believer into many literal interpretations of the Bible, including the confounding of all languages at the Tower of Babel. The “people of Jared” or “Jaredites” supposedly migrated from this tower to the New World using unknown dish-like barge technology in a 344 day journey without their language being confounded at the tower. The Jaredites arrived in the Americas in ~2,200 BC and their civilization came to an end in ~600 BC in an epic final battle in which the two opposing kings fought until king Coriantumr cut off king Shiz’s head who then died after one headless last-breath push-up.<sup><a href="#references">14</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>convincing…that Jesus is the Christ</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Smith published The Book of Mormon it settled the mound builder myth, attempted at settling differences of opinions in regards to the Bible and silence Deism and the rise of Thomas Paine’s book, The Age of Reason. Smith, in this regard, can be viewed as trying to bring understanding to the confusing religious world as it provided answers to the question of how native Americans fit into the story of Christianity. The book was written partially to convince the native Americans, who were viewed as the Lamanites, of the covenants of the Lord and converting them to Christianity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the mistake of men: wherefore condemn not the things of God</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author of the title page seemed concerned that the book would be rejected if mistakes were found and there have been thousands of grammatical mistakes in the text. Joseph claimed the book was “the most correct of any book on earth” and apologists would quickly make an argument that he was referring to doctrine and not grammatical errors. As we continue our deep dive into the Book of Mormon we will examine some of these mistakes and allow the reader to determine for themselves if the mistakes are only grammatical or are more problematic.</p>
