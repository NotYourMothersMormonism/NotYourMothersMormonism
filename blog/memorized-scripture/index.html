  <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen I was a missionary in the California, Roseville mission for The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I spent many hours memorizing scripture. My mission president Danel Bachman was a 
Mormon scholar and influenced the time I spent studying the history, doctrine and scripture of the Mormon church. I had
hundreds of 3x5 cards to assist me in memorizing scripture but I lost them over the years. Here are the majority of scripture
I had or still have memorized:</p>

  <li><a href="#old-testament">Old Testament</a></li>

<h4 id="genesis-126-27">Genesis 1:26-27</h4>

<p><strong>26</strong> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>

<p><strong>27</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="job-1925-26">Job 19:25-26</h4>

<p><strong>25</strong> For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</p>

<p><strong>26</strong> And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="isaiah-118">Isaiah 1:18</h4>

<p><strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="isaiah-245">Isaiah 24:5</h4>

<p><strong>5</strong> The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="isaiah-2911-14">Isaiah 29:11-14</h4>

<p><strong>11</strong> And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="isaiah-558-9">Isaiah 55:8-9</h4>

<p><strong>8</strong> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="jeremiah-14-9">Jeremiah 1:4-9</h4>

<p><strong>4</strong> Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="ezekiel-3715-17">Ezekiel 37:15-17</h4>

<p><strong>15</strong> ¶ The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying,</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="daniel-244-45">Daniel 2:44-45</h4>

<p><strong>44</strong> And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p>

<p><strong>45</strong> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="amos-37">Amos 3:7</h4>

<p><strong>7</strong> Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="amos-811-12">Amos 8:11-12</h4>

<p><strong>11</strong> ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord:</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find <em>it.</em></p>

<h4 id="matthew-313-17">Matthew 3:13-17</h4>

<p><strong>13</strong> ¶ Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer <em>it to be so</em> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="matthew-1615-19">Matthew 16:15-19</h4>

<p><strong>15</strong> He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong> And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="matthew-2237-39">Matthew 22:37-39</h4>

<p><strong>37</strong> Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>

<p><strong>38</strong> This is the first and great commandment.</p>

<p><strong>39</strong> And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-31-5">John 3:1-5</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-316-17">John 3:16-17</h4>

<p><strong>16</strong> ¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-717">John 7:17</h4>

<p><strong>17</strong> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-1016">John 10:16</h4>

<p><strong>16</strong> And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-1415">John 14:15</h4>

<p><strong>15</strong> If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-146-9">John 14:6-9</h4>

<p><strong>6</strong> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-1426">John 14:26</h4>

<p><strong>26</strong> But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-1513-14">John 15:13-14</h4>

<p><strong>13</strong> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="john-173">John 17:3</h4>

<p><strong>3</strong> And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="acts-238">Acts 2:38</h4>

<p><strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="acts-319-21">Acts 3:19-21</h4>

<p><strong>19</strong> ¶ Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</p>

<p><strong>21</strong> Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="acts-755-56">Acts 7:55-56</h4>

<p><strong>55</strong> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</p>

<p><strong>56</strong> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="acts-2028-30">Acts 20:28-30</h4>

<p><strong>28</strong> ¶ Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</p>

<p><strong>29</strong> For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</p>

<p><strong>30</strong> Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="romans-53-5">Romans 5:3-5</h4>

<p><strong>3</strong> And not only <em>so,</em> but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="romans-63-6">Romans 6:3-6</h4>

<p><strong>3</strong> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <em>him,</em> that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="romans-816-17">Romans 8:16-17</h4>

<p><strong>16</strong> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="romans-838-39">Romans 8:38-39</h4>

<p><strong>38</strong> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</p>

<p><strong>39</strong> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="romans-1013-17">Romans 10:13-17</h4>

<p><strong>13</strong> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="1-corinthians-1013">1 Corinthians 10:13</h4>

<p><strong>13</strong> There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="1-corinthians-13">1 Corinthians 13</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="galatians-16-8">Galatians 1:6-8</h4>

<p><strong>6</strong> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="galatians-522-23">Galatians 5:22-23</h4>

<p><strong>22</strong> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</p>

<p><strong>23</strong> Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="ephesians-110">Ephesians 1:10</h4>

<p><strong>10</strong> That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="ephesians-219-20">Ephesians 2:19-20</h4>

<p><strong>19</strong> Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="ephesians-411-15">Ephesians 4:11-15</h4>

<p><strong>11</strong> And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-thessalonians-21-4">2 Thessalonians 2:1-4</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="1-timothy-41-3">1 Timothy 4:1-3</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-timothy-43-4">2 Timothy 4:3-4</h4>

<p><strong>3</strong> For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>

<h4 id="hebrews-11-3">Hebrews 1:1-3</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</p>

<h4 id="hebrews-121-2">Hebrews 12:1-2</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="hebrews-129">Hebrews 12:9</h4>

<h4 id="2-peter-21-2">2 Peter 2:1-2</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</p>

<p>We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost.
Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is His revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the Second Coming of the Messiah.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="1-nephi-37">1 Nephi 3:7</h4>

<p><strong>7</strong> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="1-nephi-1736">1 Nephi 17:36</h4>

<p><strong>36</strong> Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be inhabited; and he hath created his children that they should possess it.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-nephi-26-9">2 Nephi 2:6-9</h4>

<p><strong>6</strong> Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-nephi-227">2 Nephi 2:27</h4>

<p><strong>27</strong> Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-nephi-324">2 Nephi 3:24</h4>

<p><strong>24</strong> And there shall rise up one mighty among them, who shall do much good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the hands of God, with exceeding faith, to work mighty wonders, and do that thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the bringing to pass much restoration unto the house of Israel, and unto the seed of thy brethren.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-nephi-252326">2 Nephi 25:23,26</h4>

<p><strong>23</strong> For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</p>

<p><strong>26</strong> And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible. Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews?</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another. And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-nephi-314-7">2 Nephi 31:4-7</h4>

<p><strong>4</strong> Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-nephi-3113">2 Nephi 31:13</h4>

<p><strong>13</strong> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism—yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-nephi-3119-20">2 Nephi 31:19-20</h4>

<p><strong>19</strong> And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="2-nephi-323">2 Nephi 32:3</h4>

<p><strong>3</strong> Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</p>

<h4 id="jacob-218-19">Jacob 2:18-19</h4>

<p><strong>18</strong> But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong> And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="jacob-44-7">Jacob 4:4-7</h4>

<p><strong>4</strong> For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his name. And for this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do these things.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="mosiah-317">Mosiah 3:17</h4>

<p><strong>17</strong> And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="mosiah-49">Mosiah 4:9</h4>

<p><strong>9</strong> Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="mosiah-141-12-isaiah-53">Mosiah 14:1-12 (Isaiah 53)</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="alma-710-16">Alma 7:10-16</h4>

<p><strong>10</strong> And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="alma-1142-43">Alma 11:42-43</h4>

<p><strong>42</strong> Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death.</p>

<p><strong>43</strong> The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="alma-348-9">Alma 34:8-9</h4>

<p><strong>8</strong> And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="alma-3417">Alma 34:17</h4>

<p><strong>17</strong> Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</p>

<p><strong>32</strong> For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="alma-4023">Alma 40:23</h4>

<p><strong>23</strong> The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="alma-4222-24">Alma 42:22-24</h4>

<p><strong>22</strong> But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.</p>

<p><strong>23</strong> But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.</p>

<p><strong>24</strong> For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and teachers were baptized; and they were not baptized save they brought forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> And none were received unto baptism save they took upon them the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> And they did meet together oft to partake of bread and wine, in remembrance of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>46</strong> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail—</p>

<p><strong>47</strong> But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</p>

<p><strong>48</strong> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.

<p><strong>11</strong> And their little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the remission of sins.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a respecter to persons; for how many little children have died without baptism!</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</p>

<p><strong>33</strong> And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> O Lord God Almighty, maker of heaven, earth, and seas, and of all things that in them are, and who controllest and subjectest the devil, and the dark and benighted dominion of Sheol—stretch forth thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy pavilion be taken up; let thy hiding place no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion toward us.</p>

<p><strong>36</strong> That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</p>

<p><strong>37</strong> That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.</p>

<p><strong>38</strong> Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God.</p>

<p><strong>40</strong> Hence many are called, but few are chosen.</p>

<p><strong>41</strong> No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</p>

<p><strong>42</strong> By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile—</p>

<p><strong>43</strong> Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;</p>

<p><strong>44</strong> That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.</p>

<p><strong>45</strong> Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit. In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect, and I felt some desire to be united with them; but so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, [first chapter and fifth verse], which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to “ask of God,” concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong> So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong> After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong> But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction—not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being—just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong> It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—<em>This is My</em> Beloved <em>*Son</em>. Hear Him!*</p>

<p><strong>18</strong> My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)—and which I should join.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong> I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: “they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.”</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> He again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, “Never mind, all is well—I am well enough off.” I then said to my mother, “I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.” It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?</p>

<h4 id="the-articles-of-faith">The Articles of Faith</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong> We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong> We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong> We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong> We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong> We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong> We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong> We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul—We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</p>

<p>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities.</p>

<p>Sacrifice pertains to mortality; in the eternal sense there is none. Sacrifice involves giving up the things of this world because of the promises of blessings to be gained in a better world. In the eternal perspective there is no sacrifice in giving up all things—even including the laying down of one’s life—if eternal life is gained through such a course.</p>

<p>I am called of God. My authority is above that of the kings of the earth. By revelation I have been selected as a personal representative of the Lord Jesus Christ.
He is my master and He has chosen me to represent Him. To stand in His place. To say and do what He Himself would say and do if He personally were ministering to the very people to whom He has sent me.
My voice is His voice and my acts are His acts. My words are His words and my doctrine is His doctrine.
My commission is to do what He wants done, to say what He wants said, to be a living modern witness in word and deed of the divinity of His great and marvelous latter-day work. How great is my calling!</p>
