    Minute Read</p>

  <p>The 34 wives of Joseph Smith haven’t received the attention in Mormon history they deserve. The following paintings of Smith’s wives were done by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/us/mormon-leader-joseph-smiths-34-wives-inspire-utah-artist.html">Leslie O. Peterson</a>. The personal histories or each wife can be found in each link below the paintings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emma Hale Smith Bidamon was the first wife of Joseph Smith and a leader in the early days of the Latter Day Saint movement, both during Joseph’s lifetime and afterward as a member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frances Ward (“Fanny”) Alger Custer (September 30, 1816 – November 29, 1889) was possibly the first plural wife of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, although scholars have disagreed about whether Smith’s relationship with Alger was an early plural marriage or simply a sexual indiscretion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Even before her association with Joseph Smith, this woman had a story to tell. She was married to a famous Anti-Masonic martyr, a notable character in Nauvoo and also to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith at age 37. She was also a mother, an early pioneer and frontierswoman, and left it all behind to become a Catholic nun and serve in the Civil War.” - Lindsay Hansen Park</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In spite of Agnes’ husband Don Carlos Smith’s opposition to the practice… Agnes would marry Joseph Smith, allegedly as an Old Testament marriage (where the brother married another brother’s widow). The marriage was guarded with secrecy. On January 6, 1842 Brigham Young wrote a cryptic entry in his journal using Masonic symbols. Decoded, it reads: “I was taken in to the lodge J Smith was Agness”. The abbreviation “was” means “wedded and sealed”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is some debate over the exact date Sylvia was sealed to Joseph Smith, but most sources agree that it was some time around February 8, 1843, which was around the time when Windsor was excommunicated for suing a fellow member in civil court over money that was owed to him. There is some debate whether Sylvia’s marriage to Jospeh was before or after Windsor’s excommunication, and whether Sylvia and Windsor separated for some period during that time. Painting by Leslie O. Peterson. 2015.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Patty’s daughter Sylvia was married to Joseph Smith. It’s not clear whether Patty knew of the marriage, but it’s likely she did, or found out soon after, since she herself was married to Joseph a month later. Patty wrote in her journal: I was sealed to Joseph Smith by Willard Richards March 9, 1842 in Newel K Whitney’s chamber Nauvoo, for Eternity…Sylvia was presant when I was sealed to Joseph Smith.

  <p>“On the 3d month, 27th, 1849, William Arrowsmith of August, Lee county, Iowa, about sixteen miles from Nauvoo… He never was a Mormon, but he married the sister of the Mormon apostle John Taylor. The Mormons persuaded his wife to leave him and they robbed him of 100 dollars worth of property. He says… that he, William Arrowsmith, slept at his mother-in-law’s, who was a Mormon, when Joseph Smith slept with Orson Hyde’s wife, under the same roof.“ - John Bowes Painting by Leslie O.

  <p>Elizabeth was said to be a good friend of Emma Smith’s, although it is most likely Emma did not know of the marriage… Elizabeth and Emma Smith also had the famous conversation, reported through Zina Huntington where Elizabeth asked Emma if she believed Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and Emma answered, “Yes. But I wish to God I did not know it.”</p>

  <p>Delcena’s brother Benjamin left for Canada on a mission. He returned in July of 1842. He later wrote, “The marriage of my Eldest Sister to the Prophet [Joseph Smith] was before my Return to Nauvoo. and it being…admitted I asked no questions.” In Nauvoo, Delcena was living with another one of Joseph’s wives, Louisa Beaman.

He then gave Lucy an ominous ultimatum, “It is a command of God to you. I will give you untill to-morrow to decide this matter. If you reject this message the gate will be closed forever against you.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the spring of 1843, when Helen was 14 years old, her father described the doctrine of plural marriage to her. He asked if she would consent to be “sealed to Joseph”. Helen described her reaction: My father was the first to introduce it to me, which had a similar effect to a sudden shock of a small earthquake. When he found (after the first outburst of displeasure for supposed injury) that I received it meekly, he took the first opportunity to introduce Sarah Ann to me as Joseph’s wife</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to LDS Church Historian Andrew Jenson, Hannah married Joseph Smith some time before the summer of 1843. During her time in Nauvoo, Hannah lived in the home of John Benbow and perhaps with her brother Josiah for a time. John Benbow writes, “President Smith frequently visited his wife Hannah at [my] house.” It was only a little over a year of being married to Joseph that he was martyred and she became a widow.</p>

Jonathan would be sealed to Elvira for time, but she would be Joseph’s for eternity… This meant that Jonathan an Elvira’s children would become Joseph’s in the eternities.

Rhoda wrote, “In my young days I buried my first and only love, and true to that affiance [pledge], I have passed companionless through life; but am sure of having my proper place and standing in the resurrection, having been sealed to the prophet Joseph, according to the celestial law, by his own request, under the inspiration of divine revelation.” Rhoda now became Joseph’s approximate twenty-eighth wife.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Desdemona married Joseph Smith in July of 1843. As Joseph continued to secretly accumulate wives, his first wife, Emma, struggled with polygamy. Perhaps Desdemona experienced, or maybe only feared, the anguish of Emma discovering her and Joseph’s relationship. She recalls the resultant anxiety, “In the rise of poligamy i was warned in a dream Amy [Emma] Smith was going to poisen me.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Very little is know about her marriage to Joseph Smith, but LDS Church Historian Andrew Jenson records Nancy as a wife, marrying sometime before Joseph’s death. The marriage is mostly likely a dynastic union, and one can only speculate on the marriage since such little evidence is provided. Nancy would have been fourteen or fifteen years old at the time of the marriage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brigham Young recalled the fall of 1843 when he, Joseph Smith and Fanny were discussing the Mormon belief in the necessity of entering plural marriage in order to obtain exaltation and enter the celestial kingdom. Unimpressed with the doctrine, Fanny was to have said, “Now, don’t talk to me; when I get into the celestial kingdom, if I ever get there, I shall request the privilege of being a ministering angel; that is the labor I wish to perform. I don’t want any companion in that world…”</p>
