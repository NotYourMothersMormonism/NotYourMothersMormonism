<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his is my second Easter as a disbelieving member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am grateful for experiences I had in the Mormon church, grateful to the kind people in those communities called wards and stakes, and the different callings that made me feel a part of the community. While there are aspects of Mormonism I miss, I am very grateful that I feel awoken to my truth. I know it seems impossible for some family and friends to understand, especially when the church is so much of our lives and identity. The first word that comes to the mind of a believing Mormon when someone says "what is true?" is the church. Members of the church use “true” as a synonym or equivalent for church. It is incredibly difficult to question your own truth.</p>

Truth. That is what I am after. That is what led me to where I am today. I want truth. I feel 100% confident that I have followed it even though it has led me out of the only community I knew and the organization I gave my life to. The inconsiderate words, the loss of community, the misunderstandings, the ignorance, whitewashed history, gaslighting, and judgment has been a dagger to my already wounded soul that woke up to the realization that my worldview was so wrong. So, so wrong! However, the truth will set you free. In many ways it has set me free. The truth will open your eyes and heart in ways you didn’t realize your eyes were shut and your heart was hardened. The one thing Mormonism taught me was to follow the truth despite the consequences. That is what I feel I have done.

So, what do I think of Jesus of Nazareth now?

The Jesus I read about in the biblical text was a radical. He was radically inclusive. He was less interested in what people thought or which group they identified with and more interested in them loving one another. He sided with the poor and disadvantaged. He promoted the idea of selfless love coupled with sacrifice. He wanted more forgiveness and compassion toward the so-called sinners. Jesus used righteous indignation at the religious groups of his day that he saw as hypocritical to give a voice to the voiceless.
 
Although Hugh Nibley and I would now disagree with many things, and I see his apologetics as outdated and silly, I do like what he said about what the biblical Jesus was the most upset about:
 
> “The worst sinners, according to Jesus, are not the harlots and publicans, but the religious leaders with their insistence on proper dress and grooming, their careful observance of all the rules, their precious concern for status symbols, their strict legality, their pious patriotism.”
 
If Jesus were here today I doubt he would be at a temple or conference center in a soft comfortable red chair. I don’t believe in a Jesus that would be concerned about taking the sacrament with the right hand, shaving beards, single piercings, the wearing of garments, inappropriate interviews, symbols, the outward appearance that we all get caught up in, the hoarding of money while barely using a fraction of it while declaring a fast, the conformity, white shirts and ties, and usage of His name to make rules at church schools that hurt the marginalized.
 
While I no longer believe that Jesus will come to Missouri, I do believe his message can still change the world. His message was radical in that it was against the religious hypocrites and their pharisaical teachings and behaviors. He was angered at the misuse of the widow’s mite and the self-righteousness of the false prophets and teachers. I want to be like Jesus. To love as he loved, to follow truth wherever it leads, and to use humility (aka skepticism) to come out of the chains of group think and reach out to those both in and out of that group with open arms and a compassionate view that only comes from being awoken to reality.
